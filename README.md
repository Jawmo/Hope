# HopeWeb_Dev

Python-based MUD that was my excuse for learning to code. This is about a year's worth of learning to code. Feel free to use it and improve upon it!

The main goal was really to get a simple game running and to learn how Python works. I wanted to keep things extremely simple and easy to build upon and I'm really quite proud of the work for a beginner. If you improve upon it, I am more than happy to incorporate changes!

Sorry for the lack of comments.

Utilizes:
1. Python 3.6
2. Postgres
3. Django for ORM with web app and web login
4. Websockets (https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server)

To run: 
1. Create a DB 
2. Setup hope/settings to connect to it (currently setup for postgres)
3. In console: python manage.py server2.py
